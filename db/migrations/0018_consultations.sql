-- 0018_consultations.sql — a doctor's booked consultations, the doctors who
-- can sign in to see their own, and the alerts that go out when one is booked.
--
-- Append-only: never edit once applied.
--
-- @rebuild  users carries CHECK (role IN ('admin','staff','accountant')) from
--           0006 and SQLite cannot widen a CHECK in place, so the table is
--           rebuilt exactly as 0006 rebuilt it.
-- @verify   users, doctors, patients
--
-- Until now a doctor was a name on a slip and a share of the takings. Himal
-- books consultations by phone all day and wrote them in a diary, which meant
-- the answer to "who is Dr Karki seeing on Thursday" lived on one desk and
-- nowhere else. A booking is not a visit: a visit is what happened, a booking
-- is what somebody agreed would happen. They are separate rows and a booking
-- points at the visit it eventually became, if it became one.
--
-- Time of day is stored as "HH:MM" on a 24-hour clock next to the date rather
-- than as one combined moment, because a clinic books "Thursday at 2" in local
-- time and always will. The pair sorts correctly as text, which is all the
-- lists here ever need.
--
-- No CHECK on `status`, for the reason written into 0013, 0015 and 0016: this
-- project has twice rebuilt a table to widen one.

    <h2>Welcome to ClinicNP</h2>
    <p class="lede">ClinicNP runs your counter, your stock room and your patient records from one place — billing medicines and services on a single invoice, tracking every batch, following a sample out to the laboratory and back, and turning the day's work into clear numbers. This guide walks through each screen with a real picture and plain steps. No jargon.</p>
    <ul class="concepts">
      <li><b>Nepali dates.</b> Every date is in Bikram Sambat, the way you already work.</li>
      <li><b>Sells the oldest first.</b> ClinicNP always picks the nearest-to-expiry batch, and never sells an expired one.</li>
      <li><b>Works offline.</b> Keep billing with no internet; bills send themselves when you're back online.</li>
      <li><b>One bill.</b> Medicines and services go on the same invoice, printed on A4 under your own letterhead.</li>
      <li><b>Roles.</b> Owners see everything; counter staff see billing and stock. Set this up in Settings → Users.</li>
      <li><b>Your own login.</b> The owner creates an account for each person under Settings → Users. Ask them for yours — never share one, because the shop's record of who did what depends on it.</li>

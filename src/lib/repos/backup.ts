/**
 * Every table, in an order where each one's parents come before it.
 *
 * That order is what makes a restore work: rows go in parents-first, and the
 * clear-out runs the list backwards so children go first. Foreign keys are
 * deferred to COMMIT as well, so the snapshot is validated as a whole rather
 * than at each intermediate step — but the ordering means a restore is
 * comprehensible without relying on that.
 *
 * A table missing from this list is a table that silently does not survive a
 * restore, which is why `tests/backup.test.ts` compares it against the
 * database's own list of tables.

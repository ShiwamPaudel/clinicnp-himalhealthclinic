/**
 * lab.ts — where a sample actually is. All SQL for the laboratory worklists.
 *
 * Himal does not run its own laboratory: it bills a test, draws the sample,
 * sends it out, and waits for a report. Four steps, each done by a person,
 * each with a moment where the thing is sitting on a bench and somebody has to
 * know it is there. That is what this table of work is for.
 *
 * A stage is derived from which timestamps are stamped (0016), never stored as
 * a status. It cannot then disagree with itself, and every stage carries the
 * time it happened, which is the half you need when a sample has gone missing
 * and the question is who had it last.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT hold is a result. ClinicNP records that a
 * test was sent, what it cost, and that a report came back. It does not record
 * what the report said — the outside laboratory issues that, and software that
 * stores a number it did not measure starts looking like the authority on it.

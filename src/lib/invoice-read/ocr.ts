/**
 * ocr.ts — read the text off a photo of a supplier's invoice, in the browser.
 *
 * PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv6 tiny, MIT licence) runs as WebAssembly on the device.
 * That is the whole point of choosing it: the photo never leaves the phone or
 * the PC, there is no account, no key and no per-page charge, and once the
 * model is cached it works with the internet down. The photo is thrown away as
 * soon as the text is out of it — nothing is kept with the purchase (D-144).
 *
 * The model files and the runtime are served from this app, not from a CDN, so
 * a clinic on a bad line is not at the mercy of somebody else's server.
 *
 * Settings below are the ones measured against Himal's own ten bills: the tiny
 * model beat the small and medium ones on dot-matrix print and is a quarter of
 * their size, "per-line" keeps a row's figures together on one line of text,
 * which is what makes a row usable at all, and the image is scaled up rather
 * than sharpened — hard thresholding wiped dot-matrix text out completely.

 * sheet of paper is found in the photo — it is the big bright shape against a
 * darker desk — and its four corners are warped square before anything is read.
 *

/**
 * logo-image.ts — the shop's printed letterhead, small enough to live in the
 * company row.
 *
 * The header on a bill is an image, not text: a shop has a letterhead with its
 * name set the way it wants it, its logo, a Devanagari line no font here would
 * render the same way twice. So it is uploaded, and it has to survive being
 * printed from any machine at the counter, offline, on the day the internet is
 * down. That rules out a file on one PC's disk and it rules out a fetch at
 * print time.
 *
 * So the image is downscaled here, in the browser, to a data URL that is
 * stored in `company.logo_url` like any other setting — carried with the rest
 * of the company profile, cached with it, backed up with it, and already in
 * the page by the time anybody presses Print.
 *
 * The cap is what makes that honest. A phone photograph of a letterhead is
 * four megabytes, and four megabytes in a database row is a mistake that only
 * shows up as slowness weeks later. Everything is re-encoded to fit
 * MAX_BYTES — width first, then quality — and an image that cannot be made to
 * fit is refused rather than stored.

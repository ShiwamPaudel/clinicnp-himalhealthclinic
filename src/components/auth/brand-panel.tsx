/**
 * brand-panel.tsx — the half of the sign-in screen that is about the software.
 *
 * Everything here is claimed in the present tense because everything here is
 * already built. A sign-in screen that advertises what is coming is the first
 * thing a new user learns not to trust, and the list is filtered by the
 * modules actually switched on for this clinic so it can never promise a
 * screen that returns 404 (D-025).
 *
 * Sage, not navy: navy in this product means a patient is involved, and nobody
 * has signed in yet. The mark itself is the sanctioned exception, and it
 * arrives as artwork rather than as colour.
